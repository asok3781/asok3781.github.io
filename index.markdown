    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I graudated with a Bachelors of Engineering First Class majoring in Software Engineering in 2022 from the
        University of Auckland. I am someone who is always quick to adapt and works well with their hands. While my main interests lie in software, I have also dabbled in machine learning, microcontroller programming and PCB design, and CAD work in Fusion360.
