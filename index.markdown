  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
      I graudated with a Bachelors of Engineering First Class majoring in Software Engineering in 2022 from the
      University of Auckland. I am someone who is always quick to adapt and works well with their hands. I have
      interests across hardware and software, desiging custom keyboards from case to PCB to firmware using
      Fusion360, KiCad, and the open source QMK firmware. I have also created a couple of web applications which
      you
      can find on my github as part of group projects and the past, and also have a little bit of experience with
      machine learning, which I gained creating a plant monitoring system using machine vision to measure the
      growth
      of tomatoes.
