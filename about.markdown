I graudated with a Bachelors of Engineering First Class majoring in Software Engineering in 2022 from the University of Auckland. I am someone who is always quick to adapt and works well with their hands. I have interests across hardware and software, desiging custom keyboards from case to PCB to firmware using Fusion360, KiCad, and the open source QMK firmware. I have also created a couple of web applications which you can find on my github as part of group projects and the past, and also have a little bit of experience with machine learning, which I gained creating a plant monitoring system using machine vision to measure the growth of tomatoes.
